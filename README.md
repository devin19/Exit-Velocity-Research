# Exit-Velocity-Research
I explored the relationship between different Exit Velocity metrics and offensive success.

In conducting my research, I scraped Baseball Savant data from the past five years (2016-2020), then filtered the data by well-hit parameters, and finally combined it with FanGraphs data (imported via Excel). The code is split up between the scraper, the Savant Data Frames, the merged FanGraphs-Savant Data Frames, and the different plots because it was cleaner that way. Enjoy.
