# Exit-Velocity-Research
I explored the relationship between different Exit Velocity metrics and offensive success.

In conducting my research, I scraped Baseball Savant data from the past 5 years (2016-2020), then filtered the data by well-hit parameters, and finally combined the it with FanGraphs data (imported via Excel). The code is split up between the Savant Data, the merged Savant Data with FanGraphs, and the different plots, just because it was cleaner that way. Enjoy.
